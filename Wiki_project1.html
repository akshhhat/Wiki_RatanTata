    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Sir Ratan Naval Tata GBE OMRI FREng (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist and former chairman of
        Tata Sons. He was also the chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, serving also as interim chairman from
        October 2016 through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable trusts.[2][3] In 2008, he received the
        Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third
        highest civilian honour in 2000.[4]

        He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata
        Group. He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
        architecture, and the Harvard Business School through a management course he completed in 1975.[5] He joined
        Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as chairman of
        Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land
        Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business. Tata is
        also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.</p>
